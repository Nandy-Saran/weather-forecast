Citrus Leaf Miner                                ,"To keep the pest population under check, pruning of all the affected parts during winter should be done. Spraying the plants with Methyl Demeton (0.03%) and Phosphamidon (0.035%) at the emergence of new leaves is highly beneficial. Application of Phorate 10 G (2.5 kg a.i./ha) applied one day before planting is effective in reducing the larval population of leaf miner."

Citrus Butterfly                                 ,Hand picking of the larvae and spraying with Endosulphan 35 EC (2ml/10 litres of water) is effective in controlling the pest.
Fruit Sucking Moths                              ,Elimination of alternate hosts plants from the vicinity of the orchards and collection and destruction of affected fruits reduce the pest population. Uses of poison baits have proved useful.Effective bait may be prepared by mixing 15g lead arsenate and 450g molasses in 10 litres of water. A little vinegar may be added to it and the bait should be suspended from trees in shallow wide-mouthed containers.

Fruit Flies                                      ,Collection and destruction of infested fruits reduces the insect population. Use of flytraps containing  1%  Methyl  Eugenol  and  0.5%  Malathion  mixed  with  sugar  syrup  two  months  prior  to  harvesting is effective
Citrus Nematode                                  ,Soil application of Neem cake and chemicals like Temic 10G (4kg a.i./ha) are used successfully to control the  nematodes.  Intercropping  of  Marigold  has  repellent  action  and  reduces  the  population  of nematodes in citrus.
Flea Beetles                                     ,Removal of loose bark of the stem and applying paste of Copper Oxychloride and Carbaryl 50% WP after forward pruning to exposes and kills the beetles. Spraying of insecticides like Carbaryl(0.15%) or Quinalphos (0.05%) from the fourth day after pruning at an interval of 3-5 days until the emergence of the leaves is effective in protecting the sprouting bud from the attack. The spraying should preferably be carried out in the evening

Grape Scale Insects                              ,The  loose  bark  should  be  removed  at  the  time  of  pruning.  The  encrustations  should  be scraped and the vine should be sprayed with Trithion (0.05%). Cuttings free from the infestation of the pest should be used for planting. Ants which act as carrier of the scales should be controlled to check the spread of the disease
Grape Leaf Hopper                                ,Insecticides like Quinalphos (0.05%) and Monocrotophos (0.1%) are sprayed as soon as the infestation of the pest is observed.

Spraying water with high volume sprayer by focussing the nozzle towards the under surface of leaves helps in washing out the honeydew, eggs, larvae, pupae and adult whitefly. This should be followed by spraying Triazophos 40 EC (1.5 ml/litre of water) or a mixture of 1.5 ml of Monocrotophos 36SL + 1.0 ml of Dichlorvos 76 EC per litre of water. The sprays are repeated at an interval of 8-10 days. "
Chiku Bud Borer                                  ,2 sprays of Monocrotophos @ 0.05% at 15 days interval can effectively control the pest. The pest  can  also  be  controlled  by  using  light  traps  or  traps  containing  bait  of  tulsi  leaf  extract  and Dichlorvos.One trap should be placed between two trees during April-September.
Codling Moth                                     ,"The control strategy includes mass pheromone trapping (25 traps/ha), collection and destruction of over wintered cocoons during April-June and deep burying of fallen fruits during August. 2 sprays of Phosphamidon (0.04%) in June-July at an interval of 2-3 weeks is effective in controlling the pest.  "
Apple Clearwing Moth                             ,Winter spraying (when the larvae start feeding) as well as summer spraying (when the adults appear) is recommended to control the pest. Immediately on appearance of the larvae Chlorpyrifos  (0.15%) is sprayed 3 times at an interval of 20 days.
Woolly Apple Aphid                               ,Resistant rootstocks should preferably be used for grafting the desired cultivar.
